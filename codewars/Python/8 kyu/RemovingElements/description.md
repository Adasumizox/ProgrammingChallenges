# Removing Elements
Description:

Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:

```my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
