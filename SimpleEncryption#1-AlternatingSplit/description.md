# Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split
## Description:

For building the encrypted string:
Take every 2nd char from the string, then the other chars, that are not every 2nd char, and concat them as new String.
Do this n times!

## Examples:
```
"This is a test!", 1 -> "hsi  etTi sats!"
"This is a test!", 2 -> "hsi  etTi sats!" -> "s eT ashi tist!"
```
Write two methods:
```
def encrypt(text, n)
def decrypt(encrypted_text, n)
```
For both methods:
If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!
If n is <= 0 then return the input text.
